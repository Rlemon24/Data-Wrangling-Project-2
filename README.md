U.S. Economic Dashboard
Overview
The U.S. Economic Dashboard is an interactive web application developed using Dash. It enables users to explore various economic indicators and trends, with dynamic visualizations to provide insights into areas such as economic growth, government spending, wages & income, and interest rates. The dashboard also includes features like recession overlays, custom index creation, event markers, and downloadable reports.

Features
Data Overview: Filter economic data by year and select columns for analysis. The data is presented in an interactive table with options to filter values.

Charts: Interactive charts with dynamic X and Y-axis selections, including scatter plots, box plots, and bar charts over time. Recession periods and key events (e.g., 9/11, the 2008 financial crisis) are overlaid on the charts for better context.

Dynamic Filtering: Use range sliders and dropdowns to filter data based on years, columns, and approximate values.

Correlation Analysis: The application calculates and displays Pearson correlation between selected variables, indicating significant relationships.

Technologies Used
Dash: Framework for building interactive web applications.

Dash Bootstrap Components: For responsive UI design.
