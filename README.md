# Data-Wrangling-Project-2
# United States Economic Dashboard

# Overview
The U.S. Economic Dashboard is an interactive web application designed to visualize and analyze various U.S. economic indicators. Built with Dash, the application enables users to explore economic trends in real time, with interactive charts and filters that focus on key economic areas such as:

Economic Growth: Gross Domestic Product (GDP), industrial production, and real disposable income.

Government Spending: Federal government debt, expenditures, and social programs.

Wages & Income: Trends in median household income, weekly earnings, and personal savings rate.

Interest Rates & Inflation: Federal Funds Rate, Treasury Yields, and inflation rates.

Users can interact with the data using dynamic range sliders, dropdown filters, and various visualization types, including scatter plots, box plots, and bar charts.

# Key Features

Charts and Visualizations: Create scatter plots, box plots, and bar charts with customized variables on the X and Y axes.

Recession and Event Overlays: Visualize recessions and major historical events (e.g., 9/11, the 2008 financial crisis, COVID-19) on charts for added context.

Correlation Analysis: Calculate and display Pearson correlation coefficients between selected variables, highlighting relationships between economic indicators.

Customizable Sliders and Filters: Use range sliders to filter data based on years and value thresholds.

# Technologies Used
Dash: Framework for building interactive web applications.

Dash Bootstrap Components: For responsive UI design.
